1. Partitions: 
- For most implementations you want to follow the rule of thumb of 10 partitions per topic, and 10,000 partitions per Kafka cluster. 
Going beyond that amount can require additional monitoring and optimization.


2. Replication Factor:
- The replication factor is set to 3 as a default. While partitions reflect horizontal scaling of unique information, replication factors refer to backups. 
For a replication factor of 3 in the example above, there are 18 partitions in total with 6 partitions being the originals and then 2 copies of each of 
those unique partitions.
